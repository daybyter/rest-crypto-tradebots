ToDo-List
=========

App:
----

- create .tradeapp directory automagically, if it does not exist, when the settings are written.
- complete ssh server with all required commands and test the server.
- complete JDBC trade logging 
- complete trade cache in ChartProvider.
- use Akima interpolation in the trade window.


Bots:
-----

- Integrate OrderDialog completely in btc-e native bot.
- Make RuleBot usable.
- Run getAccounts via Account-Manager to avoid IP bans, if 2 bots query their funds in a very short timespan.


Framework:
----------

- rename btc-e package due to a naming conflict in eclipse?
- complete zapto client?
- rename TradeSite to TradeSiteClient and TradeSiteImpl to TradeSiteClientCore ?
- implement the TradeSite implementation as separate jars, so the trade site 'drivers' could be loaded as modules?
- write a module loader for the trade site interfaces.
- refactor the TradeOrder/DepositOrder/WithdrawOrder structure, because deposit and withdraw subclass trade order now,
  but don't need a currency pair etc.
